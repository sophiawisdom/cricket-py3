"""
This module provides a function :func:`versioning` to compute the diffs from
snapshots, and produce the lifetime of each element. Usage:

>>> import list_diff
>>> lists = [
...   [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9],
...   [3, 4, 1, 6, 9],
...   [1, 3, 4, 9, 9, 9],
...   [2, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8],
...   [2, 7, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8],
...   [2, 7, 1, 8, 2, 8]
... ]
>>> revs = list(list_diff.versioning(lists))
>>> for r in revs:
...     print("Element {0} exists from revisions {1} to {2}".format(r.content, r.low, r.high))
... 
Element 1 exists from revisions 2 to 2
Element 3 exists from revisions 0 to 2
Element 1 exists from revisions 0 to 0
Element 2 exists from revisions 3 to 5
Element 7 exists from revisions 4 to 5
Element 1 exists from revisions 5 to 5
Element 8 exists from revisions 5 to 5
Element 2 exists from revisions 3 to 5
Element 4 exists from revisions 0 to 4
Element 1 exists from revisions 0 to 1
Element 5 exists from revisions 0 to 0
Element 6 exists from revisions 1 to 1
Element 9 exists from revisions 0 to 2
Element 9 exists from revisions 2 to 2
Element 9 exists from revisions 2 to 2
Element 5 exists from revisions 3 to 4
Element 6 exists from revisions 3 to 4
Element 8 exists from revisions 3 to 5

...     assert list(list_diff.snapshot(revs, i)) == l
