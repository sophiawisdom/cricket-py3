    When this method is called with an ARM instruction, the condition code will
    *not* be included along the encoding, i.e. the *pattern* should only be
    28-bit in size. If the decoder is handling an unconditional instruction
    (i.e. the condition code must always be
    :const:`~cpu.arm.functions.COND_NONE`), the user should supply ``True`` to
    the optional parameter ``unconditional``.
