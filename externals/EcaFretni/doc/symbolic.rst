:mod:`symbolic` --- Symbolic arithmetic
=======================================

This is the symbolic arithmetic package for the EcaFretni project. Unlike other
symbolic math libraries (e.g. `SymPy <http://code.google.com/p/sympy/>`_), this
package is aimed at extensible simplification routines, which is useful for code
analysis and decompiling. Unnecessary features e.g. string parsing, calculus
etc. will not be present.
