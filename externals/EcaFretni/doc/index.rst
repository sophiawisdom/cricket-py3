EcaFretni Development Documentation
***********************************

**EcaFretni** is a collection of tools for analyzing executables in Mach-O
format. It currently consists of:

* An Objective-C interface reverser, as a replacement of `class-dump-z`_.
* An ARM Thumb-2 disassembler, as a replacement of `thumb-ddis`_.

EcaFretni is highly modularized and designed to be easily extensible, and is
therefore written in Python.

.. _`class-dump-z`: http://code.google.com/p/networkpx/wiki/class_dump_z
.. _`thumb-ddis`: http://code.google.com/p/networkpx/downloads/detail?name=thumb-ddis(v2).zip

This documentation include all public functions used in EcaFretni.
